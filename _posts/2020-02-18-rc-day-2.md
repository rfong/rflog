## bidecennial ruining of my package manager

`brew` was completely ruined for unknown reasons so I ripped it out and reinstalled everything. This took a while.

- [Homebrew/legacy-homebrew issue #25167](https://github.com/Homebrew/legacy-homebrew/issues/25167)
- [Homebrew/legacy-homebrew issue #16964](https://github.com/Homebrew/legacy-homebrew/issues/16964)

Applying the arcane wisdom from these complex issue threads left me with a [nice, normal SSL error](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/issues/1736) in `gem`.

While waiting for all my nuked `brew` packages to reinstall, I sat back for some [light reading](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/1311_05-08_mickens.pdf). I regret everything.

## useful things I learned today

- `Ctrl-t` shows you what process is currently executing in the terminal.
- Since OSX Sierra, you can toggle hidden files in finder with `Cmd Shift .`. You can also toggle this setting permanently from Terminal by setting `defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES`.
