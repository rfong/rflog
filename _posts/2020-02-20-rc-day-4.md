Like 20 other people in my batch, I thought I wanted to learn Haskell on the first day of RC, mostly because all the cool kids are doing it.

After attending a single Haskell study group, it became breathtakingly clear that I'm not actually interested in learning Haskell, although I do respect it even more now. It was a very valuable hour.

(Clojure, on the other hand, I'm still interested in...)

## Choice excerpt

"Let's use shifty eyes to get rid of all these parentheses"

```
infixr 0 >.>
(>.>) :: (a -> b) -> a -> b
f >. x f x
```
