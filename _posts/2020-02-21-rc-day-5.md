I ran in late because my bus line mysteriously ended about 20 minutes before Google Maps said it would.

## Theorem provers 101!

Pius ran a morning study group for theorem provers and helped us learn the basics of [Lean](https://leanprover.github.io/) while we went through this [interactive tutorial](http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/natural_number_game/). We proved associativity (`(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)`) and commutativity (`a + b = b + a`) of addition for natural numbers!! 

Doing math in a theorem prover was extremely different from writing it out by hand, and extremely confusing at first because I had no idea what inputs the transformations seemed to be taking. Once we proved associativity, my mind exploded and the mapping from math to theorem prover started to make a little sense.

Even though I used to be a math nerd, I have never done this before because I thought it was silly to prove properties that seemed to me to be intrinsically defined on the operator and group (and no, I never took real analysis either), but in the context of computational theorem proving I finally understand why that level of rigor is interesting and useful! Wowe.

### Decompressing

Great conversation with V and others about the dreaded "where are you *from* from" question that visible racial minorities are often subjected to.
