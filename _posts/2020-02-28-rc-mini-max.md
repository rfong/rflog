How does one actualize years of pent-up anticipation into a single week of [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/)?

## Set intentions

### Set goals for the week

#### (My goals)
1. Feel excited about computers again.
2. Connect with a lot of self-directed and interesting people. *(It turns out this is an extremely effective way to achieve goal #1.)*
3. Explore a technical area I have little to no experience in.

### Ask: What can you get here that you can't get elsewhere?

For me, it's the people and their shared learning intentions. I can get heads-down coding time anywhere I'm alone with wifi, a power outlet, and a place to sit.

Figure out what you specifically want to get out of being physically present at RC, and then optimize for it.

### Preparing to maximize the week

I spent a few hours fiddling with my package manager, which feels like an awful lot relative to a week-long scope. Ideally, I would have done a lot more preparation. *(Unfortuitously, I was sick the week before RC and then rehearsing all day for a dance performance right up until I had to get my stuff and go to the airport to redeye to NYC.)*

#### Technical recommendations

- **Set up** any nontrivial packages, such as languages, frameworks, and data-heavy libraries, that you are interested in using.
- If you plan to fiddle with an unfamiliar technology, **familiarize** yourself with it beforehand. Having the basic tutorials out of the way will free up your time to collaborate and build the stuff you're excited about.
- Make sure there's free space on your hard drive. This is a perpetual battle against entropy for me; disk visualizers such as [Disk Inventory](http://www.derlien.com/) or [WinDirStat](https://windirstat.net/) are quite helpful.
- Bonus: **start building** out a project idea if you have time! It doesn't matter how much you "achieve"; the simple act of building will help you think it out.

#### Brainspace recommendations

- **Talk** with people on the RC chat and welcome threads the week before you go. It's a good way to gauge shared interests and get inspired by other people's ideas, and you might even inspire other people with your own ideas.
- Flesh out some project ideas and pick one that will be your **top priority**. You certainly don't need to stick to it, but it's helpful to have a well-known initial direction to kick off from, even if you change your mind mid-week.

## Unexpectedly lovely things about RC

In the process of (2), I got sidetracked by many unexpected wonders (linguistics, theorem proving, feeling in solidarity while bemoaning the "but where are you *from* from" question) and expected distractions (talking about interesting past projects with people, fiddling with synthesizers, eating tasty food). I also enjoyed unexpected horrors during RC, such as nuking and resetting my entire package manager. Overall, it was an excellent and valuable meander through a welcome and inspiring space.
