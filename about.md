I have been computer-whispering since 2001, but somehow never instantiated a code blog until 2020. From past iterations of myself, I have fond memories of learning algorithms from the [USA Computing Olympiad](http://www.usaco.org/), being obsessed with [speedcubing](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/), studying computer science at [MIT](http://mit.edu/), co-organizing the first 3 [SF Stupid Hackathons](http://stupidhackathon.github.io/), helping out with the inaugural [o11ycon](https://o11ycon.io/), and doing a mini-batch at [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) in NYC.

My software interests include data pipeline engineering, never making the same mistake twice, improving team communication & shared knowledge, code maintainability, and dabblings into distributed systems and natural language processing. My non-software interests are gratuitous in scope but ultimately finite; the most relevant crossovers into software-land are probably linguistics, music, and robotics. See my [homepage](https://rfong.github.io) for a fuller inventory.
