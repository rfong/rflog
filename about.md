title: About
---

My software career interests include distributed systems observability & resilience, data engineering, enabling my teams to never have to make the same mistake twice, and work culture & team communication. I love software that's local-first, intentionally low-tech, ultralight, or that generally tries its best not to get in the way of being present in the physical world.

My non-career interests are gratuitous in scope but ultimately finite; the most frequently relevant crossovers are probably linguistics, music, education, robotics, and self-awareness. See my [homepage](https://rfong.github.io) for a fuller inventory.
