I have been computer-whispering since 2001, but somehow never instantiated a code blog until 2020. From past iterations of myself, I have fond memories of learning algorithms from the [USA Computing Olympiad](http://www.usaco.org/), being obsessed with [speedcubing](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/), studying computer science at [MIT](http://mit.edu/), co-organizing the first 3 [SF Stupid Hackathons](http://stupidhackathon.github.io/), helping out with the inaugural [o11ycon](https://o11ycon.io/), and continuing my trajectory as a lifelong learner at [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/).

My software career interests include distributed systems observability & resilience, data engineering, never making the same mistake twice, work culture & team communication, and occasional natural language processing.

My non-career interests are gratuitous in scope but ultimately finite; the most frequently relevant crossovers are probably linguistics, music, education, robotics, and self-awareness. See my [homepage](https://rfong.github.io) for a fuller inventory.
